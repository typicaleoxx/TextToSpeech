# TextToSpeech

Description:
TextToSpeech is a Python script that utilizes the pyttsx3 library to enable text-to-speech functionality on your computer. With this script, you can type any text, and your computer will speak it aloud. Whether you want to hear the latest news, listen to your favorite quotes, or simply have a conversation with your computer, TextToSpeech offers a convenient solution.

Key Features:
- Converts typed text into spoken words using the pyttsx3 library.
- Provides a simple interface for users to input text and listen to computer-generated speech.
- Runs seamlessly on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Adjustable speech settings, allowing users to modify voice speed, pitch, and volume.

Concepts Used:
- External Libraries: Utilized the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech synthesis.
- User Input Handling: Accepted user input to determine the text for speech synthesis.
- Function Calls: Invoked functions from the pyttsx3 library to initiate speech synthesis.

How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the pyttsx3 library using pip: `pip install pyttsx3`.
3. Download or clone the repository containing the TextToSpeech.py script.
